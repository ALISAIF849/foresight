            "Especially with what happened to you last year, you could have been in a much worse state, but you really pulled yourself together. Will she actually hand over the photograph? The policewoman won't provide it to you? You didn't? Will she really? But bro, how was your— how did you handle all of that? My life has changed completely. So much has shifted. And as an artist, I've also transformed. I thought that was my truest self. That's where true art originates. But art's very identity has also changed. It's become much more raw. Out of that chaos, it came more real. Yeah, absolutely. I'm perfectly fine with having lost so much— my money and my mental health. 10 days before that whole incident, I had gone through a really terrible breakup, so I was already trying to cope with that. And then all of this unfolded. I was just like, oh my goodness, what the fuck is happening? So it was like a complete emptying out, a catharsis even of that chaos or that darkness. Let's just see how wrong things can actually get. Yeah, I mean, anyone who was opening YouTube or turning on the TV, they would just see my face. And 3 or 4 years ago, we recorded a vlog right around the time of COVID when the pandemic first hit. This is you? Yeah, this is actually in Assam. I could have been a supervillain, you know, if circumstances were different. But you're really not acting like yourself, friend. It's just me, you know. This is what happened to me. So yeah, I really miss making YouTube videos from my room. You know, and that's exactly what I was thinking. Like, damn, I mean, I actually started out right from my room making fitness videos. How to make paneer. How to make healthy paneer. And from that point to this one. So I'm just like, wow, what a life. My big beer biceps. Yeah, and also the very nature of the world, the nature of people. I have traveled a lot, you see. I truly understand people. Understanding people is actually my job. But I am seeing the world from a very different lens now. Priorities have changed. I don't chase anyone. Initially, there were some biases? Yes, so many times. Someone you idolize can just change as a human being and their priorities completely shift. I've realized that in the worst situations, when your entire world falls apart, only your true friends and family will remain. Let me think. And you know, when all this started happening, I was feeling so much fear from my dad. I thought he would call me and shout because he has a strict very particular about things. I was very scared, but he understood what was happening. He simply, he simply called me up and said, uh, handle yourself, chill. And that was the most important call in all of this. Like, I've spoken about this publicly, but for a very long time I hadn't spoken to my dad, almost for like 15 years. And we'd been healing things for the last 2 or 3 years, and we were meeting, but I think this incident healed it completely. Okay, so you were in that period with your father to heal and to recover. You know, we were already kind of healing. Now we're totally— we're like brothers because he's also faced a pretty significant downfall and he's really managed to come out of it stronger in life. So, uh, Kiro, uh, from his perspective, it was— it's— it was like, uh, okay, now it's his turn to deal with this. Like, he just gave me exactly what I needed, which was simply space, because everyone was talking so much. I didn't want to talk to anyone. I spoke to like 5 or 6 people, all famous, all people who had handled controversial controversy, just to get a playbook. So what was I supposed to do? And everyone just told me to handle things myself because it was just too chaotic. It was like my phone was constantly ringing saying, that's me, and then I was on TV. It was too much for— out of— I thought, I'm sorry if anyone feels it's making a big deal out of nothing, like it was something huge, but for me it was crazy. For you, man, you must have had a totally different spiritual experience with this. Yeah. I also saw, you know, there were tweetstorms, paid tweets were surfacing. So I realized that when you're down, many people want to see you even further down. I witnessed some loving. Oh, so paid tweets. So that means people were deliberately getting tweets done? Yes. And they were being amplified through PR campaigns. So I am like, wow, the world is very mean, you know, but it's okay. Not a problem. On some level, there was also that self-belief that I'll manage. And you knew all along who was orchestrating all these things. Oh my God. But it was a really, really emptying experience. And then it only started hurting me, you know, 3 months later. 3 months. I was just thinking to myself, what in the world is going on here? I was— I don't even know how to put it. I was so completely confused. I was just like, uh, I— How long was this period? Sorry, I— Man, I honestly feel that things are finally okay. All right. The world just moves on and forgets. Like, But in my life, so much has truly happened. I have lost far too much, you know, my opportunities, my money, my mental health, absolutely everything. And the world just does all these things to you, then simply moves right on. Then you're left behind. Yeah, you might fall down, but you have to get back up and score that goal. That's the kind of spirit and determination I'm talking about. I think right now I'm just starting running again. Okay. The goal is a little bit far off, but I'll definitely achieve it. I think you know who has truly helped me? The real winners in life. They've understood the situation and offered their help, and they haven't, they haven't left my life. Those who have genuinely achieved things in life, they truly understand the nature of media. They understand the complexities of fame. And I want to say, I love you, and I'm telling you this with so much love. You know, I'm always a well-wisher for you. But don't be surprised if something like this happens to you at some point. It's something that will happen to anyone who wants to be famous, I believe. I'm not even a big celebrity. I'm just a YouTuber. I'm certainly not Shah Rukh Khan. I know. But like, this exact same thing happened to me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, of course. Sorry, I'm just ranting like this. No, I'm just ranting. I actually prefer listening to speaking. I can listen to my friends for hours, man. And by listening, I don't just mean hearing, but actively listening, like truly being there. I'm also seeing, you know, that those people who are fed up with life, I'm subconsciously profiling them somewhere deep down. And through this profiling, my pattern recognition is improving. So now I know the relationship. So I need to invest time and effort. So when it's becoming clear what the types are and profiling is becoming clear. Basically, I thought I understood the world, that I was street smart. I truly believed I was very street smart, but it turns out I'm not street smart at all. However, I will become street smart, and I've already improved a lot. But then again, what can I say? My intentions changed. Before, I think I was primarily moving forward for personal growth. Just like the concept of growth, the people around me had a football mentality. For them, it was all about scoring goals so the team would win. Now, I think that goalpost has shifted. First and foremost, it's about finding enjoyment in your work, but also understanding that enjoyment isn't the only thing that sustains you. And second, it's about being valuable. I believe if you focus on these these two things, everything else will naturally fall into place. Enjoy or can be your value. Yeah. But those have truly been two significant lessons for me. Not to chase after things and certainly not to place anyone on a pedestal. I'll simply be myself. I've become much more raw now. The person I am deep down inside, I believe, will finally emerge. It's been cathartic. I actually have a good relationship with everything that happened. In fact, I wouldn't mind experiencing it all again. But you see, now from that is visible from a bit of a distance. I mean, it's kind of— That's you. It's reached a point of closure now. Yeah, like I don't really think I need to process it any further at this point. I've already processed it quite extensively, you know. Now I'm just putting all of that emotional energy into my art. What else is there for me to do with it really at this stage? What else to do? Of course, what's its use? Play and have fun. Crazy, isn't it? This is going to be a really big experience for you. It's just crazy. I need to direct films either right now or— Just go straight ahead. You know. Definitely, at some point. A lot. Have you written anything or do you have a script? I've written some stuff. Yeah, I haven't written the entire script, but I've got it all written down in my head. I know exactly what I want to say. I know I will be a good director. Like, people don't understand that through YouTube you can actually learn a lot about filmmaking because— Ashish, dude, he's actually made a complete full-length film for YouTube. Pause. He incorporated comedy, horror comedy, and full-on production values. He did such a brilliant job. Pause. Everything he showcased, we— he truly did an absolutely phenomenal piece of work. He will certainly go on to become a truly legendary director. This very talented individual, our YouTube talent, needs to move beyond YouTube now, I feel. Or it absolutely needs to transcend. This is my last opportunity. Your work should also be something that truly transcends. How do you feel? What are your thoughts about YouTube? YouTube talent moving away from the platform, moving away from that idea of YouTube, or perhaps That's exactly how things ought to be. But the thing is, what used to happen in the past, you know, if for instance, if women wanted to act, I really love the fact that he actually left it. He had to make a certain sacrifice for that particular image. If he hadn't done that and was also trying to do this at the same time, then it would have been quite difficult. But now he's made that sacrifice, though now things will unfold for him and whatever he pursues, I'll be truly happy because for certain individuals, I feel immense joy. For Bhuvan, he's such a good person. I genuinely see his purity. He's also faced many challenges, incidents, and even COVID. A lot is riding on him, so I feel he understands that sacrifices will definitely have to be made for that particular thing to move forward. For example, in reality shows, it's very difficult for them to act because it's a reality show where they end up showing all their true emotions. They reveal every facet of their personality. Every side is shown, so the audience has already witnessed all their dimensions. Why would they then come to watch a character in a movie? Don't show all your sides to everyone, man. Oh, that's truly magnificent. You see, just look at history. Even the most accomplished actors face this challenge. It's a problem because the audience has already witnessed everything. All your dark secrets, every aspect of your hidden side, your moments of extreme joy, your tears, your shouts, your curses, your abusive language. Everything has been laid bare, completely exposed to them. This is exactly what's happening. With Smith. Okay, that's precisely what you're saying. I love this unpolished, raw approach. I'm a huge fan. But the narrative about him is that he's been a bit too exposed. So that's the problem, that the audience says, oh, I've seen it, and they want to see it exactly like that again. It gets fixed, no? There's a famous dialogue from Batman in The Dark Knight that says you either die a hero or live long enough to become a villain. So true, isn't it? Except for Shah Rukh Khan, of course. Oh my. Oh, almost. That's a different story already. That's a completely separate thing. You know, it's just a whole other matter. Very sharp, very shrewd. They were breaking rules.\n"
